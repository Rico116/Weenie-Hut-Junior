 <p> My name is Justin Rico and I attend Summit Shasta High School. I am currently in the 11th grade, and I have lived in the South San Francisco area for most of my life. I was born and raised here in the US, while my parents are from the Philippines. Just recently, I went to the Philippines and got to see where my parents grew up.   </p>
