<h1 id="k"> Hobbies of Mine: </h1>

<p> One hobby of mine is playing video games. I like it because of how it can be competitive. I got into playing video games at a young age, when my mom bought a Nintendo Wii. Some of my favorite parts about video games is how you can play a bunch of different games to find the one that is right for you. </p>
