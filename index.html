    <p> My name is Justin Rico and I attend Summit Shasta High School. I am currently in the 11th grade, and I have lived in the South San Francisco area for most of my life. </p> 
    <p> My 2 favorite things are video games and technology. I like these because I use these a lot in my everyday life. </p>
    <p> One hobby of mine is playing video games. I like it because of how it can be competitive. I got into playing video games at a young age, when my mom bought a Nintendo Wii. Some of my favorite parts about video games is how you can play a bunch of different games to find the one that is right for you.
