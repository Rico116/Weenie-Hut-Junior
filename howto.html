Starting off with how I made this sentence, I used the paragraph tag, which is < p > ,but without the spaces between. <br> The closing tag would be < /p > , also without the spaces. 

<p> To get the Header, you would use the tag < h > , and close it with < /h >. </p>
<p> To get the Navigation Bar, I used the tag, < ul > , which stands for "Unordered List", and would put items in the list by using the tag, < li > , which stands for "List Item". </p>
<p> In order to get the background image, I used the tag < img src= "URL_of_Picture" >. </p>
<p> To customize certain text, like the header, I used the < style > tag. For this tag to work, you have to set an ID for what you are trying to change. You do that by adding < h id= "Hey"> This Is A Header < /h >. </p>

<p> For the process of making a calculator involves the use of HTML and JavaScript. The calculator relies on JavaScript the most, because it handles the actual math. The code I used is the .addEventListener("click", function() ,which makes it so that the browser "listens" for a click, The other important piece of code I used was the operation and .innerHTML code. the operation code makes it so that the browser will recognize it has to perform a specific mathematical equation. </p>
